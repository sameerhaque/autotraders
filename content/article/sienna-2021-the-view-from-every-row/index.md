  #### Up Front:


  The driver and front passenger are treated to a commanding view of the road, with **great visibility and light coming from the huge windshield and side windows.** Sitting in the wide front seats, the high centre console creating a cocoon around the driver and passenger, making it feel more like a car than a minivan. That console has a **large cargo box,** of course, but **it also hides a clever open area underneath to house a purse or handbag** with easy access. For the driver, every control falls easily at hand, and the **optional power tilt and telescoping steering wheel** – a class first – means a perfect driving position for anyone. The 9-inch **infotainment screen is easy to read and operate,** with hard buttons for its features and actual knobs for both volume and tuning, simplifying things. Charge a phone on the **QI wireless charging pad** in the dash or take advantage of the **USB-A and USB-C ports,** one of which also connects to the infotainment. The rear door controls are centrally located in the ceiling so either driver or passenger can operate them. And if rear visibility is hindered by passengers or cargo, the **available Digital Display Rear View Mirror** – a first in the segment – solves that problem; it operates as a normal mirror until it is flipped up, where it turns into a video screen, fed by the rear camera. So many thoughtful touches in this roomy cabin mean even more usefulness and comfort for everyone.

  #### Second Row:


  If there’s no one in the 3rd row, passengers in the middle can enjoy a limousine-like ride; **the optional captain’s chairs slide an astounding 63.5 centimetres,** enough for taller people to stretch their legs out fully. Even the standard bench-seat configuration is quite clever; it can be used as a standard three-person setup, or the **middle seat can be removed to have two seats that slide separately.** The chairs are cushy and wide, and the backs can recline for even more comfort. Up top in the ceiling are the **optional climate controls for the rear,** while in front of the passengers, the driver’s console has **USB-A and USB-C ports for charging,** an **optional 1,500W inverter** and **optional HDMI port** – that’s for the available entertainment screen that drops down from the ceiling. Large windows bring the light and scenery inside, while the four cupholders, **available window privacy shades,** a bag hanger on the centre console and lower grab rail for children round out the thoughtful touches here; it really is a perfect place to relax on a longer road trip.

  **The 2021 Toyota Sienna was built with passengers in mind.** How does that actually work when you travel in it? To answer that question, we took the Sienna XSE for a spin while sitting in each row and checking out features that are unique to each seat and passenger. 


  Let’s take a look at the comfort and convenience from each row of seats.


  #### Third Row:


  Toyota has made the third row truly adult size, starting with getting back there in the first place. **The second-row Captains Seats slides all the way forward** and, with the large door opening, access is easy. The seats are firm but comfortable, and **the 60/40 seat backs can recline for even more relaxation.** Headroom is generous, even for people over six feet tall, and with the second row adjusted forward, you can stretch your legs out. And if you want to tune out for the long trip, put up the privacy shades, plug in your headphones to the jack with volume control for the available **HD Rear Seat Entertainment System,** charge your electronics with the **USB-A or USB-C ports** and just chill. Climate vents in the ceiling and cupholders in the sides will help make the ride even more comfortable.
