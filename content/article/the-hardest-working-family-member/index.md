  For our **#VanProud campaign,** we wanted to see what made vans so attractive to so many people. As it turns out, the features and capabilities vans provide make them a **perfect fit for busy lives.** Here are a few ways in which a van goes above and beyond simply carrying people.

  #### Equipped for the road trip

  Is the van the ultimate road-trip vehicle? The 2021 Sienna could just be. Of course, it has the comfortable space for up to eight passengers, but a host of other features also makes it ideal for getting away from civilization. **The optional JBL 1,200-watt, 12-speaker audio system is perfect for road tunes,** or the **available entertainment system, with an 11.6-inch screen, HDMI port and wireless headphones,** will keep the rear passengers’ attention. Available all-wheel drive helps on those slippery cottage roads, while the available **1500W power inverter, with household plugs both in the centre cabin and in the rear cargo area,** means that the kids can play their game consoles inside, or parents can run saws or other tools for fixing up the off-grid cabin. Or, of course, run a blender or waffle maker for a little bit of civility.

  #### DIY is easy as pie


  The Sienna isn’t just for transporting families; it can also be a versatile cargo van to help with bigger jobs, such as home DIY or furniture renovations. With the third-row seats folded down and the second row folded forward, **there is a full 2,860L of cargo space available behind the front seats** with a flat floor for all the tools and building materials you could need for renovating your basement or redoing the back garden. And the wide rear and side doors, with the **available Kick Sensor feature,  can also open hands-free with the swipe of a foot,** make it easier to load and unload, especially the heavier things. If there’s something that’s just a little too big to fit inside, **every Sienna can be equipped to tow up to 3,500 lbs.** And what’s great is that, after the van is unloaded, it goes back to family duty in moments by just pulling the seats back up. There’s no other type of vehicle with this kind of versatility.

  #### An office on wheels


  The Sienna isn’t just a cavernous carry-all or comfortable people-mover; it’s also packed with technology that can make it your mobile office. If you need to get some laptop work done, stretch out in a rear seat with your latté close at hand in a cupholder. And with the **1500W power inverter located behind the centre console,** you can take along a printer or other office equipment you may need to get any job done. And maybe even a coffee maker, if it’s going to be a long day. 


  Of course, being able to carry seven or eight people means you can bring clients or colleagues just about anywhere, either to the construction site, a real estate showing, or wherever work takes you, all in spacious comfort. The bonus is that, **with every Sienna rolling on a hybrid powertrain, you are getting better fuel economy than many compact hatchbacks.** Everyone can agree how good that would be for the bottom line.
