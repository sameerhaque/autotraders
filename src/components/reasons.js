    reviewDescription: `<p>The XSE and Limited versions of the Sienna have <strong>available 2nd row Long Slide Captains Chairs</strong> that open up incredible room for passengers. They both independently slide up to 63.5 centimetres, giving even tall people enough room to stretch out. The third row is also designed for adults to be comfortable, too, and not just children.</p>`,

    reasonDescription: `<p>We bought a minivan mainly for the family, but I’m also on the road a lot with my sales job, and I like the added room for my samples. But I also appreciate the alone time, too. For one thing, it’s great I can pair my phone with Bluetooth and take calls on the road. But I also like to just play the music I want, instead of what the kids want. <strong>I can be a picky audiophile, and the satellite radio helps keep me tuned in to my favourites.</strong></p>`,
